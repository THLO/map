*** Build Scripts ***
*********************

The following scripts facilitat the build process.

NOTE: The scripts SHOULD be run from the root of the project, i.e.,
they should be run as follows:

./scripts/build_tar
./scripts/build_deb
./scripts/build_signed_deb
./scripts/submit_to_launchpad

build_tar
---------

This script builds the tarball in the folder dist.
The script dist/install can then be invoked to install it.

build_deb
---------

This script builds the deb package in the folder deb_dist.
It can be installed by calling dpkg -i [package name].deb.

build_signed_deb

This script extracts the files from the deb, changes some
meta information, signs the data, and builds the signed
package.

submit_to_launchpad
-------------------

PREREQUISITE: build_signed_deb MUST have been executed before.
This script uploads the newly built package for distribution via Launchpad.
